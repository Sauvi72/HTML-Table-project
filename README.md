# HTML Table Project

This project is a simple HTML-based timetable/schedule created while learning the fundamentals of web development. It is one of my first projects and was built to practice the use of table elements in HTML. The main focus of the project is to understand how rows, columns, and headers can be structured to display information clearly and effectively.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Pure HTML Project**: No CSS or JavaScript has been used.  
- **Timetable Design**: A weekly schedule created with `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` tags.  
- **Clean Structure**: Easy to read and understand for beginners.  
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Simple layout that can be improved further with CSS styling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I was able to:
- Learn the difference between `<th>` (table headers) and `<td>` (table data).  
- Practice how to divide content into rows and columns.  
- Understand how tables can be used to organize structured data.  
- Build confidence in writing clean, properly indented HTML code.  

This project also helped me appreciate the importance of semantic HTML and how even a basic table can be a strong exercise for practicing core concepts.

## ðŸš€ Purpose
The purpose of this project was not to create something advanced, but to gain hands-on experience with one of the fundamental elements of HTML: the table. It represents the early stage of my journey in learning web development and coding. Though small, this project acts as a milestone, reminding me of my starting point and the skills I picked up along the way.

## ðŸ“‚ Future Improvements
- Adding CSS for styling and better visual design.  
- Using JavaScript to make the timetable interactive.  
- Making the schedule responsive for mobile devices.

## âœ… Conclusion
This HTML Table Project may be small, but it has been an important stepping stone in my learning process. It shows how basic HTML tags can be combined to create something useful, while also preparing the foundation for more advanced web development projects in the future.
